<h2>Abstract</h2><p>The BioC format provides a lightweight offline annotation framework (for JSON or XML-formatted data) with very lightweight semantics but has not, to date, been developed as linked data. In this ontology, we provide a simple serialization of BioC classes and attributes for easy publishing to a semantic-web-compatible framework. This is preliminary work and will require additional mapping to existing Web Annotation standards.
